        <p>We're not looking for any specific roles right now. But that doesn't mean that we're not looking for you. Finding talented people is hard, and we're always looking for folk who can help us improve our work.</p>
        <p>Or, put it this way, for the right person, we'll create a new role.</p>
        <p>So, if you have the sort of talent that is going to help a growing digital agency thrive, then we'd love to hear from you. Whether your skills are in design, programming, copywriting, strategy, account management, project management or something more esoteric (we have two doctors of psychology on staff, so we really do mean that), if you believe you are good enough to make a difference then let us know.</p>
        <p>Sound like you? Email <a href="mailto:recruitment@readingroom.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20work%20at%20Reading%20Room">recruitment@readingroom.com</a> and tell us why we should create a role for you. Oh, and include your CV and portfolio, if relevant.</p>
